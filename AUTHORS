The Spacewar ROM:

This file contains the assembly language and machine code for
Spacewar!, the original PDP-1 video game.  It is downloaded from
http://spacewar.oversigma.com/sources/sources.zip which has
the following notice at http://spacewar.oversigma.com/:
 
Spacewar! was conceived in 1961 by Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell,
and Wayne Wiitanen. It was first realized on the PDP-1 in 1962 by
Stephen Russell, Peter Samson, Dan Edwards, and Martin Graetz,
together with Alan Kotok, Steve Piner, and Robert A Saunders.
Spacewar! is in the public domain, but this credit paragraph must
accompany all distributed versions of the program.

This is the original version! Martin Graetz provided us with a
printed version of the source. We typed in in again - it was about
40 pages long - and re-assembled it with a PDP-1 assembler written
in PERL. The resulting binary runs on a PDP-1 emulator written as
a Java applet. The code is extremely faithful to the original. There
are only two changes. 1)The spaceships have been made bigger and
2) The overall timing has been special cased to deal with varying
machine speeds.

The a, s, d, f keys control one of the spaceships. The k,n
l, ;, ' keys control the other. The controls are spin one
way, spin the other, thrust, and fire.
